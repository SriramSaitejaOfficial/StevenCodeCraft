//Variable is like a container. Every variable has a unique name assigned to it.
//Variables can be used to store data, which can be accessed and modified later in the program
//Variables can also be initialized with let keyword.
//We usually follow camelCase naming convention for variables.

var firstName = "John"; //String variable

//Programmers refer to this kind of data as a string, which is a sequence of characters. These are enclosed by quotes.

//Reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names.
//Modern way of declaring variables is using let keyword.
